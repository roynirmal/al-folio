I am currently (since September 2019) doing my PhD in the [Web Information Systems](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/web-information-systems/){:target="\_blank"} group of [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/){:target="\_blank"} under the guidance of [Claudia Hauff](https://chauff.github.io/){:target="\_blank"}. I also obtained my Computer Science MSc degree (August 2019) under her with a specialisation in Data Science. I have a BSc degree (August 2016) in Electrical Engineering from [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/){:target="\_blank"}, Kolkata. I also worked in [PriceWaterhouse Coopers, India](https://www.pwc.in/){:target="\_blank"} for a year as a technical consultant before catching my flight for this beautiful city of Delft.

My research is focussed on understanding how user's search while they are trying to learn a complex topic (e.g. the causes and implications of glogal warming or the offside rule in football) on the internet. It also encompasses devising methods to help them efficiently learn while they are searching for the said complex topics. What do I mean by efficiently learn? Yeah, that forms a part of my research as well. Recently, we conducted an experiment where we tried to understand at what point of a search session does a user learn the most. Read it more in our published work! In the future, we will look into the effect of providing scaffolding (or help) in the form of important subtopics to learn. I might be interested in working with the conversational systems as well towards the same goal.

During my master's thesis, I observed the effect of training word embeddings with less data and their eventually effectiveness in information retrieval (IR) task. We saw that convolutional layer helps in data scarce situation over traditional embeddings like CBOW. Needless to say, I am interested in most things that falls within the holy interesection of information retrieval and natural language processing. 

If you are still reading, here's more about me: I love football - playing, watching, arguing, re-watching, re-palying. I love hiking, mountains and Indian food are the only things I miss in this otherwise beautiful country. I have recently been working out (in the gym) as well. More recently, I want to run a marathon. I love meeting new people and taking up organisational responsibilities. I have been involved with [IP Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/practical-matters/introduction-period/msc-and-exchange-august/){:target="\_blank"}, [Latitud](https://www.latitud.nl/){:target="\_blank"} and a number of events in the past. The fear of missing these 9am meeting make me wake up early in the morning.  However, documentaries make me stay up late at night. Dig nerd jokes and [shower thoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/){:target="\_blank"}. In conclusion, I would say I am a decently fun person.
