  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Disclaimer: This one will be a lot of introspection: figments of thoughts stitched in a slapdash manner.</p>

<p>September to January passed by in a jiffy. Looking back, it doesn’t feel like they were 5 long months. The feeling can definitely be attributed to the million submissions I had to make and the suspense of whether I will meet the deadlines. Although I distinctly remember, there have been a few days in that period that felt like a decade in itself. Well, what’s university life if you don’t have days where everything goes wrong!</p>

<p>The learning curve has been steeper than K2(I love mountains, hence the reference), all the credit of which goes to my professors and project partners. I have learnt so much in the last two quarters, that at times I feel I have a halo of enlightenment on my head. They say ignorance is bliss, but being ignorant towards so many cool things out there can be stupidity as well. I am glad that I took the decision of doing my masters from TU Delft. So far Pattern Recognition and Data Visualisation have been my favorite courses. Not only have I gathered so much knowledge, I have been lucky enough to be befriended by some of the most amazing people I know. Birds of a feather, maybe. I have also realized that I am a bigger nerd than what I thought I was – I love reading research papers, studying in the library and look forward to exams.</p>

<p>Other than being surprised by these unraveling, I have kept quite busy. I have been TA-ing(teaching assistants) Bachelor courses, hosted a party, improved my game(football), made my food edible. Recently, I joined the Introduction Program team as a student assistant. My work will be developing and updating the website and the mobile application.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, I will be lying if I say I didn’t have fun in these 5 months. Right now I am contemplating how to spend my summer – internship or starting with thesis. No matter what the decision is, I will make a blog on it!</p>

<p>Coming to think of it, 2 quarters of the first year mean one quarter of my master’s study. The thought is both intimidating and exciting. Among all the philosophical uncertainty of the future, one thing is for certain – I will keep on learning new things during my time in TU, which might end up being the two best utilized years of my life !</p>
