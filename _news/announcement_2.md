I participated in the [ICT with industry](https://ict-research.nl/ict-with-industry/){:target="\_blank"} workshop at Lorentz center, Leiden. Together with a group of 7 people from different backgrounds we worked on a case presented by [Sound and Vision](https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en){:target="\_blank"}. We designed a pipeling wherein journalists can access a data collection from within and outside a given platform.
